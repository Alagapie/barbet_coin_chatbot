Aggressive marketing initiatives will be launched concurrently to raise awareness, interact with the community, and provide the framework for later stages. This combined emphasis guarantees a robust beginning in terms of community support as well as finances. Phase 2: Official Launch on Exchanges Barbet will formally launch on a few cryptocurrency exchanges after the presale. With the projects introduction onto the larger market at this phase, a larger audience can now obtain the tokens. The groups main goal will be to maintain the tokens stability and liquidity on exchanges so that trading will be easy for all parties. Throughout this stage, optimizing visibility and appeal will require constant marketing initiatives and strategic alliances with exchanges.
